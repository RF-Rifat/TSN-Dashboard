# React Vite Dashboard UI

This repository contains a modern dashboard UI built with **React** and **Vite**. It‚Äôs designed to be fast, easy to customize, and suitable for a variety of web applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # OR using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# OR using yarn
yarn dev
```

After running the command, Vite will start a local development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to view the dashboard.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized build for production, run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# OR using yarn
yarn build
```

This will generate static files in the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, you can use:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run preview

# OR using yarn
yarn preview
```

This will start a server to preview the production-ready files at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the main folders:

- `src`: Contains the main source code, including components, pages, and assets.
- `public`: Static files like images, icons, and meta files.
- `dist`: The output folder for the production build.

### Customizing the UI

Feel free to modify the components in the `src` folder to customize the dashboard to your needs. This setup uses modular components to make it easy to adjust layout, colors, and other styles.
